# K-Closeness

You are given an array A of length N, and an integer K.
You can perform the following operation:

- Choose any index i (1≤i≤N), and increase Ai​ by K.

Find the minimum possible value of max⁡(A)−min⁡(A) attainable, if you can perform this operation as many times as you like (possibly, zero times).
